# LQS Quick Reference Guide

## What is LQS?
**Lead → Quote → Sale** pipeline tracker with marketing ROI analytics.

---

## The Pipeline
```
LEAD ──────────► QUOTED ──────────► SOLD
(New prospect)   (Got a quote)      (Bought policy!)
```
Status upgrades automatically when you add quotes or sales.

## How to Add Data

| Action | How | Result |
|--------|-----|--------|
| **Add Leads** | Upload lead file OR add manually | Creates households as "Lead" |
| **Add Quotes** | Upload quote report | Matches to household → status becomes "Quoted" |
| **Add Sales** | Upload sales report | Matches to household → status becomes "Sold" |

---

## Matching Rule
All uploads match by: **`LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_ZIP`**

Example: Upload quote for "John Smith 12345" → finds existing lead "SMITH_JOHN_12345"

⚠️ **Misspellings break matching!** "JON" ≠ "JOHN"

---

## Lead Sources (Critical for ROI!)
- **What**: Where the lead came from (Google Ads, Mailer, Referral, etc.)
- **Why**: Tracks marketing spend vs. revenue earned
- **Action**: Always assign a lead source! No source = no ROI calculation

## Two Views

| View | Who Uses It | Shows |
|------|-------------|-------|
| **Agency Wide** | Owners/Managers | All team data |
| **My Numbers** | Individual Agents | Only your data |

---

## Key Metrics

| Metric | What It Means |
|--------|---------------|
| **Quote Rate** | % of leads that got quoted |
| **Close Rate** | % of quotes that sold |
| **ROI** | Commission earned ÷ Marketing spend |
| **Cost per Sale** | How much each customer costs to acquire |

## Dashboard Tabs

- **All** – Every household in selected status
- **By Source** – Grouped by lead source (marketing channel)
